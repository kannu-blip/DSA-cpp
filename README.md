# DSA-cpp
Structured DSA preparation in C++ for software engineering internships and placements.

# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice done in C++
as part of my preparation.

I am solving problems in a structured, topic-wise manner instead of random practice,
with a focus on understanding patterns, writing clean code, and improving
problem-solving skills.

## Language Used
- C++

## Problem Sources
- NeetCode 250
- LeetCode

## Topics Covered
- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

## How I Practice
- Problems are grouped by topic
- Each solution includes a clear approach and complexity analysis
- Emphasis is on learning concepts, not just solving for count

## Goal
To build strong DSA fundamentals and become interview-ready for
software engineering roles.

This repository represents consistent learning and gradual improvement
over time.
